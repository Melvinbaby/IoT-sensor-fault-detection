Project 1 : An IoT Based Autonomous Sensor System for Aeroponics

In recent years, Irrigation systems are becoming increasingly necessary due to human population growth , global warming and demand for food. Therefore it is necessary to increase the yield for the human population. In Aeroponics, plants mature in the growth chamber under full control by supplying the solution of the nutrient with a slight mist for the replacement of the soil. During the plant cultivation, several steps including temperature, humidity, light intensity, water nutrient solution level require proper attention for flouraProject 1 : An IoT Based Autonomous Sensor System for Aeroponics

In Aeroponics, plants mature in the growth chamber under full control by supplying the solution of the nutrient with a slight mist for the replacement of the soil. During the plant cultivation, several steps including temperature, humidity, light intensity, water nutrient solution level require proper attention for flourishing plant growth. An internet of things-based irrigation monitoring and control system, employing sensors and actuators can be adopted to facilitate the autonomous supply of adequate water from a reservoir to domestic crops in a smart irrigation systems.
